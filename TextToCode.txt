How I Built a Personal AI Lab Using ChatGPT, Raspberry Pi, and Voice Commands

"Hey Pi, what’s my next task?" My Raspberry Pi responds: "You have a meeting in 10 minutes, and two tasks pending in your GitHub issues."

This isn't some big tech lab project. I built it over the weekend using simple tools, a Raspberry Pi, and OpenAI's ChatGPT API. Here’s how you can do the same and bring AI into your everyday workspace.

What This Article Covers

How I integrated ChatGPT with a Raspberry Pi to create a smart personal assistant

Added voice input/output using open-source tools

Built a lightweight dashboard to monitor interactions

Used Python for automations like controlling lights or reading GitHub commits

Why I Built This

I wanted something JARVIS-like: personal, private, and customizable. AI is everywhere now, but I wanted it to feel close — like a co-pilot in my workspace.

Goals:

Interact with AI via voice, not keyboard

Automate tasks like checking to-dos or starting Pomodoro timers

Learn while building something genuinely useful

Tools & Setup

Hardware:

Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB or 8GB recommended)

USB Microphone + Small Speaker

Software:

Python 3.8+

Flask for local dashboard

OpenAI API

speech_recognition, gTTS, flask_socketio, requests

How It Works

1. Voice Input

Using Python's speech_recognition with Google Speech engine:

import speech_recognition as sr
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Listening...")
    audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)

2. Send Query to ChatGPT

import openai
openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": text}]
)
reply = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']

3. Convert Text to Speech

from gtts import gTTS
import os
speech = gTTS(text=reply, lang='en')
speech.save("response.mp3")
os.system("mpg123 response.mp3")

4. Add Automation Hooks

If response includes certain keywords, trigger Python scripts. Example:

if "turn on lights" in reply:
    os.system("python3 light_control.py")

Optional: Build a Local Dashboard

Flask + Socket.IO to stream inputs and outputs

Show live status, triggered events, and prompt history

Enable manual input or editing prompt templates

Smart Features I Added

Real-time GitHub summary (reads aloud your last 3 commits)

Integration with Todoist (reads your pending tasks)

AI-generated daily motivation quotes

System health checks via voice: CPU, RAM, disk

Challenges I Faced

Voice latency and accuracy

Rate limits on OpenAI

Building a natural tone in voice output (switched voices often)

What’s Next

Replace Google speech engine with Whisper for local transcription

Emotion detection via voice tone

Direct Calendar integration for smart time suggestions

Final Thoughts

This project turned my Raspberry Pi into something genuinely useful — a true personal AI lab. It’s not just about automation, it’s about learning how to build your own tools.

"We don’t need to wait for AI to come to us. We can bring it into our space, on our terms."

Try it. Customize it. And let AI work with you, not just for you.
